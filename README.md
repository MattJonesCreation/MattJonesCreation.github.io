This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).<br>
The main branch for this repo is Source. Since this is a User Page on GitHub Pages, the master branch is used as a deployment branch. 

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install` 

Installs all necessary dependencies.<br>
Needs to be run when you first clone the repository. 

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm test -- --coverage`

Launches the integrated coverage reporter.<br> 
Note that tests run much slower with coverage so it is recommended to run it separately from your normal workflow. 

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run deploy`

Deploys the app to production using GitHub Pages to do the hosting.<br> 
It uses the `homepage` field to determine the root URL in the built HTML file.

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
